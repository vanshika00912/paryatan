                                    The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi,
                                    India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
                                    Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he
                                    decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its
                                    design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj
                                    Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
                                    combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

                                    The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the
                                    Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently
                                    demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's
                                    defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a
                                    garrison.

                                    On 15 August 1947, the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the
                                    Indian flag above the Lahori Gate. Every year on India's Independence Day (15
                                    August), the prime minister hoists the Indian tricolour flag at the fort's main gate
                                    and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from its ramparts through the Public
                                    Address System of Indian Army Signals.

                                    The Red Fort was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007 as part of the Red
                                    Fort Complex

                                    Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, c. 1630
                                    Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he
                                    decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah
                                    Jahan's favourite colours, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori,
                                    who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed
                                    the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred Islamic
                                    month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6
                                    April 1648. Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are
                                    asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort The fortress-palace was a focal
                                    point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's
                                    successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private
                                    quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance
                                    to the palace more circuitous.: 08

                                    The Red Fort, or Lal Qila, encapsulates the rich tapestry of Indian history,
                                    culture, and heritage within its magnificent walls. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                                    and an enduring symbol of Mughal grandeur, it carries the legacy of centuries of
                                    cultural fusion and artistic brilliance. The fort's resplendent red sandstone
                                    architecture, adorned with intricate designs, arches, and domes, exemplifies the
                                    aesthetic sensibilities of the Mughal era. It was once the epicenter of Mughal
                                    power, where emperors held court and celebrated festivals, fostering a unique
                                    cultural atmosphere. Today, the Red Fort continues to resonate with cultural
                                    significance, hosting India's Independence Day celebrations and offering a
                                    mesmerizing sound and light show that narrates the history of Delhi and the fort. As
                                    a premier tourist attraction, it serves as a gateway for visitors to immerse
                                    themselves in India's multifaceted culture, connecting with its past, admiring its
                                    artistry, and embracing its enduring spirit. The Red Fort stands as a testament to
                                    India's rich cultural heritage, where history and culture intertwine to create an
                                    awe-inspiring and evocative experience.</p>

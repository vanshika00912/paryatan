                                    The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located
                                    near the Kartavya path on the eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi,
                                    formerly called Rajpath. It stands as a memorial to 84,000 soldiers of the Indian
                                    Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders,
                                    Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far
                                    East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some
                                    soldiers and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate. Designed
                                    by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman
                                    triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches;
                                    it is often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in
                                    Mumbai.

                                    Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black
                                    marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by four
                                    eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, called Amar Jawan
                                    Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since 1971 served as India's tomb of the
                                    unknown soldier. India Gate is counted amongst the largest war memorials in India
                                    and every Republic Day, the Prime Minister visits the gate to pay their tributes to
                                    the Amar Jawan Jyoti, following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate is
                                    often a location for civil society protests.

                                    The India Gate, an iconic monument in the heart of New Delhi, is a solemn tribute to
                                    the valor and sacrifice of Indian soldiers. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, its
                                    construction commenced in 1921 and culminated in 1931. This majestic structure,
                                    standing at 42 meters in height, was erected to commemorate the Indian soldiers who
                                    perished while serving in the British Indian Army during World War I. Inscribed on
                                    its walls are the names of over 13,000 soldiers, serving as an eternal reminder of
                                    their bravery. The addition of the Amar Jawan Jyoti in 1971, an eternal flame,
                                    extended the monument's purpose to honor the fallen heroes of subsequent wars.
                                    Beyond its historical significance, the India Gate is a symbol of national pride and
                                    unity, hosting significant ceremonial events and serving as a gathering place for
                                    the public, surrounded by beautifully landscaped lawns. It stands as an enduring
                                    testament to India's commitment to remembering its past and honoring the sacrifices
                                    of its soldiers.

                                    Culture refers to the shared set of beliefs, values, practices, traditions, customs,
                                    arts, and way of life that characterize a particular group of people, society, or
                                    community. It encompasses the collective identity, social norms, language, religion,
                                    rituals, art forms, cuisine, and other aspects that define the uniqueness of a given
                                    society or civilization. Culture is not static; it evolves over time, influenced by
                                    historical events, interactions with other cultures, and changing societal dynamics.
                                    It plays a significant role in shaping individuals' behavior, perceptions, and
                                    interactions within a society, and it often forms the foundation for a sense of
                                    belonging and identity among its members. Cultural diversity, the coexistence of
                                    different cultural backgrounds within a single society or on a global scale, is a
                                    hallmark of the modern world, enriching human experiences through the exchange of
                                    ideas, traditions, and perspectives.</p>

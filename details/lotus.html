                                    The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was
                                    dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a
                                    prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus
                                    Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification. The
                                    building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters
                                    of three to form nine sides, with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a
                                    height of slightly over 34 meters and a capacity of 1,300 people. The Lotus Temple
                                    has won numerous architectural awards and has been featured in many newspaper and
                                    magazine articles.

                                    The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La
                                    Jolla, California, after spending some years in Canada. He was approached in 1976 to
                                    design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design
                                    was undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months, and the
                                    construction was done by ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited at a cost
                                    of $10.56 million. The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated
                                    by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will dictated that his
                                    entire life savings would go toward the building of the temple.[page needed] A
                                    portion of the construction budget was saved and used to build a greenhouse to study
                                    indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.

                                    The Lotus Temple, located in Delhi, India, is a prominent cultural and architectural
                                    symbol. It embodies principles of the Bahá'í Faith, which emphasize the unity of all
                                    religions and the harmony between science and spirituality. The Lotus Temple's
                                    design is an architectural marvel, resembling a blooming lotus flower with 27
                                    marble-clad petals. It symbolizes purity, serenity, and the interconnectedness of
                                    different faiths.

                                    Culturally, the Lotus Temple promotes inclusivity and welcomes people of all
                                    backgrounds and religions to meditate, pray, or simply find solace in its serene
                                    surroundings. It's a place where visitors can contemplate their spiritual beliefs in
                                    a tranquil environment. The Bahá'í Faith encourages the pursuit of knowledge, the
                                    elimination of prejudice, and the promotion of peace and unity, values that are
                                    reflected in the cultural and spiritual atmosphere of the Lotus Temple. It has
                                    become an iconic destination for tourists and spiritual seekers alike, contributing
                                    to India's rich cultural tapestr</p>
